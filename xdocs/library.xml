      <p>
	Getting up to speed on Fissures is currently more difficult than it
	should be, largely due to the fact that the code has outpaced the
	documentation. In addition, the design was large done by a very small
	group of people, and so the detailed knowledge of the system is
	in only a few heads.
      </p>
      <p>
	The place to understand Fissures objects at their most fundamental
	level is the IDL itself. Of course, understanding the syntax and how
	it is mapped into a given programming language is needed as well.
      </p>
      <p>
	Another useful place is the javadocs that are generated both directly
	from the IDL and fromm the java source code compiled from the IDL.
	Some of the difficulties in syntax of IDL are removed by looking
	at the java derived version, but with the added complexity of the
	additional helper classes generated for each IDL entity.
      </p>
      <p>
	Looking at existing client and server applications are also very 
	useful. There are dummy implementations of some services, and
	other implementations written for real-world use.
      </p>
      <p>
	Lastly, anyone interested in developing software that is Fissures 
	friendly should be signed up for the fissures-dev email list.
	Questions can always be posted and maybe even answered.
