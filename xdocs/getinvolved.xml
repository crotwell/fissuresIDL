      <p>
	We do not currently have a very formal system for being involved in 
	FISSURES, or for submiting suggestions or code. Basically, if you
	are interested, you should <a href="mail.html">subscribe</a> to the
	mailing list, and post your suggestions there.
      </p>
      <p>
	If you have a project that you are working on that is Fissures-friendly
	and would like to let others know about it, send 
	<a href="mailto:www@seis.sc.edu">me</a> an email and I will add it to
	the list of related projects.
