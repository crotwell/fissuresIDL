Fissures.idl
1)	ElementId ???
2)	Response objects, use seed??? blockettes 53-61 and app.C

IfNetworkMgr.idl
1)	add ClockType NTP_CLOCK
2)	NetworkAttr - put code first
3)	StationName???
4)	Station should have code, StationAttr have name
5)	change site_id to code
6)	rework instrumentation
7)	time corrections
8)	Instrument - Time clock_drift???
9)	ChannelAttr should not have InstrumentConfig,
	separate method for getting InstrumentConfig for a time
10)	Support for virtual networks, maybe separate service
11)	ChannelAttr effective_time should be type TimeRange
12)     StationAttr doesn't have any connection to NetworkAttr (Ramesh)
13)     The is no way to get to NetworkAttr (Ramesh)
14)     There is no way to get to ChannelAttr, SiteAttr or StationAttr (Ramesh)


IfTimeSeries.idl
1)	ComplexNumber is also in Fissures
2)	ShortSeq, etc are not used in TimeSeriesDataSel
3)      TimeSeriesDataSel, EncodedData -> EncodedDataSeq

IfDataCenter.idl
1)	data_point_count -> numPoints
2)	why time_corrected  (maybe ok)
3)	SeismogramData extend TimeSeriesAccess and TimeSeriesAdmin
4)	LocalSeismogram extend TimeSeriesAccess and TimeSeriesAdmin
5)	DataCenterCallback - should seismograms alwys be returned all at once
	or might a few be returned at a time, ie datacenter uses several calls,
        maybe add a finished(id) call so client knows when request is finished?

IfSeismogramMgr.idl
1)	comments say DataCenter
2)	move Plottable to Fissures
3)	MirrorFilter - change "name" and site "id" to "code"
4)	Many methods on SeismogramXXX might also be useful on LocalSeismogram
5)      Should append operations have a sequence number so that the client can
        tell if it received a duplicate packet, or missed one. Possible due to
        multithreading issues?
6)      Sould be able to get SeismogramData from a SeismogramAccess without
        using its type
7)      create_from_ref in SeismogramFactory should take SeismogramAccess
        instead of Seismogram
8)      MirrorFilter is very similar to RequestFilter from IfDataCenter
9)      Should be a way to get a callback to give to a remote SeismogramDC
        to add data to local storage
10)     method to get channel names known to a SeismogramFactory or 
	FactoryMirrorRegistry to allow mirroring of only the channels wanted
11)	Should channelId be more like MirrorFilter instead of string?
12)	No way to update a seismogram's data
13)	Should set_attributes also have audit entry
14)	Should attributes have to be updated as a whole, or should they be 
	updated individually, ie set_sampling, set_y_unit, etc.
15)	

IfEventDC.idl
1)	Mechanism for client to listen for "new event" events
2)	Also listen for new origins on a known event?
3)	

IfEventMgr.idl
